* Nginx configuration for Piwik

** Introduction 

   This is a nginx configuration for running [[http://piwik.org][Piwik]].

   It assumes that the domain affect to Piwik is stats.example.com.

   Change accordingly to reflect your setup.

** Features

   1. Filtering of invalid HTTP =Host= headers.

   2. Filtering of referrer when serving the piwik JS or any other
      static file.

   3. Hiding of all text files.

   4. Constraining of PHP file handling. Only =index.php= and
      =piwik.php= are allowed. All other attempts to run a PHP file
      return a 404.

** FastCGI configuration

   The FastCGI configuration uses a UNIX socket. I provide an [[http://github.com/perusio/php-cgi][init
   script]] for FastCGI.
